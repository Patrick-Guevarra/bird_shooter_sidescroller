# bird_shooter_sidescroller

This is a 2D bird shooter game made in C++ using DirectX 11. You play as a bird that can fly around, shoot bullets, and fight off waves of enemies. Every few rounds, a boss appears that’s tougher and shoots faster. The game includes animated sprites, sound effects, and a scrolling background to make everything feel more alive.

What the Game Includes:
Player-controlled bird with animation and movement

Enemies that fly and shoot bullets

A boss that appears every 5 rounds and gets harder

Sound effects for shooting, enemy hits, and round changes

Score, lives, and round display using custom fonts

A scrolling background for a smooth side-scroller feel

How to Run It:
Make sure you’re using Windows with Visual Studio 2022 installed.

Clone the repo or download the files.

Open the .sln file in Visual Studio.

Build and run the game.

Make sure the image and sound files (like bird.png, enemy.png, and .wav sounds) are in, otherwise the game might crash or not load visuals.
